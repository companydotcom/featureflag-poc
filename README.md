# LaunchDarkly Next.js App Router Demo

This is a sample LaunchDarkly implementation on Next.js v13 using the App Router with Client and Server components and various rendering strategies. It demonstrates how to integrate LaunchDarkly feature flags into a Next.js application.

##  Integrating LaunchDarkly React SDK in Next.js
### Challenges and Solutions


When working with client components in Next.js, it's important to understand how Next.js handles client-side prerendering and its implications on browser-specific libraries like the LaunchDarkly React web SDK. Next.js improves page load times by prerendering both Client and Server components on the server and sending prerendered HTML to the browser. This makes page load times faster, especially for pages with lots of content and complex JavaScript. During server-side prerendering, Client components do not involve hydration, which can cause runtime errors when browser-specific APIs are used such as when calling LaunchDarkly React SDK `asyncWithLDProvider`.

To avoid this, consider implementing the following:

1. Initialize the LaunchDarkly React SDK in a Client component.
2. Use code-splitting to defer the loading of the React web SDK until page hydration phase.
3. Call the [use() hook](https://github.com/acdlite/rfcs/blob/first-class-promises/text/0000-first-class-support-for-promises.md#usepromise) to enable async calls in the Client component. Read the[ React RFC](https://github.com/acdlite/rfcs/blob/first-class-promises/text/0000-first-class-support-for-promises.md#why-cant-client-components-be-async-functions) *why Client components can't be async functions.*
4. When loading the asyncWithLDProvider component, call `dynamic()` and set the `ssr` option to `false` to disable server-side rendering.

Here is an example of how to incorporate these modifications:

> Client component: `components/AsyncWithLDProvider.js`
```
'use client';

import { use} from "react";
import { asyncWithLDProvider } from "launchdarkly-react-client-sdk";

export default function AsyncLDProvider({ children }) {
 
  //  1. Call use() hook,
  //  2. Initialize LaunchDarkly SDK as usual

  const LDDynaProvider = use(
    asyncWithLDProvider({
      clientSideID: "<client side ID> ",
      context: {
        kind: "user",
        key: "user-key-123abc",
        name: "Sandy Smith",
        email: "sandy@example.com",
      },
    })
  );
  return <LDDynaProvider>{children}</LDDynaProvider>;
}
```

then use in  `app/layout.js`:

```
import dynamic from "next/dynamic";
import { Suspense } from "react";

// 1. Disable SSR
// 2. Defer loading the Client component

const AsyncLDProvider = dynamic(
  () => import("@/components/AsyncWithLDProvider"),
  {
    ssr: false,
  }
);

export const metadata = {
  title: "LaunchDarkly Demo",
  description: "Generated by create next app",
};

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang='en'>
      <body>
        <Suspense>
          
          <AsyncLDProvider> {children} </AsyncLDProvider>

        </Suspense>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```


## Prerequisites
- LaunchDarkly account
- Node.js version >= 16.8.x
- Next.js version 13.x
  
>This [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project was bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).



## Setup
1. Create a feature flag in your LaunchDarkly account with the following details:

   | Flag Key      | Flag Type | Description         |
   | ------------- | --------- | ------------------- |
   | simple-toggle | boolean   | Toggles flag status |

2. Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required packages by running:

    ```
    npm install
    ```
4. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add the following environment variables:
    ```
    LAUNCHDARKLY_SDK_KEY="<LaunchDarkly Server-side SDK Key"
    CLIENT_SIDE_ID="<LaunchDarkly Client Side ID>"
    ```
    Replace `<LaunchDarkly Server-side SDK Key>` with your LaunchDarkly server-side SDK key and `<LaunchDarkly Client-side ID>` with your LaunchDarkly client-side ID.

## Running the Demo

1. Start the development server:

    ```
    npm run dev
    ```
    > Note: If you encounter a Server 500 error while running the app, as discussed in [vercel/next.js#49677](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/49677), switch to Node.js version 16.8.
2. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
